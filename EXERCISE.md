# Welcome to Crystal Spark dev exercise ðŸ¥³

## Setup

Prerequisites for this exercise:
* Make sure you have a working PHP7 or PHP8 local environment with composer
* Make sure you have a local Typescript running environement
* Make sure you have local MySQL database

Clone this project. 

Make a copy of .env.example and rename it .env
modify the field to give access to your database:

```
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=sandra
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

Then run:

`composer update`

then:

`php artisan test:start`

This will create or empty the required table and
add data. Take a look at the file 

`app/Console/Commands/Game.php`

You will see a datagraph initialized with some data: take a look 
at the code to understand relations created.

This is an overlook of the tables generated and the data structure:

Copy the folder `app/yourNameExercise` and rename it with your name. Then modify the file for the exercises: this file will contain all needed work and will be used for us to debrief together on the test outcome.

##  Part I: SQL

###  Exercice 1

Write an SQL query returning testgame_SandraTriplets table with instead concepts id foreign keys
in testgame_SandraConcept, the column "shortname" of the concept IF exists otherwise the 
column "code". See the following image as expected result

###  Exercice 2

From previous query, filter in order NOT to display any annoying insect related triplet

## Interlude: A bit about Laravel

If you are not familiar with laravel and you would like to just run your code, you can use the console command file at
`app/Console/Commands/TestGameExecute.php`
and run it through the console by doing

`php artisan testgame:execute`

You can simply modify the class used to point to your own class namespace:

```
namespace App\Console\Commands;
use App\yourNameExercise\MainExercises; //modify
use Illuminate\Console\Command;
```

##  Part II: PHP

We are going to use the library SandraCore to make some data queries on the datagraph.
The goal is to display country and city names in a preferred language.

We are going to "simply" display all the cities with their respective country. 
The catch is some cities and country names are localized in certain languages.
By default we display the name in english. If a specific language is defined we display the name in
the defined language if available if not we display english localization or the default name.

###  Exercice 3

Write a script that will return an array of strings of all the cities with their respective countries

```
Array
(
    [0] => London - United Kingdom
    [1] => Delhi - India
    [2] => Paris - France
    [3] => Prague - Czech Republic
    [4] => Geneva - Switzerland
    [5] => Zurich - Switzerland
)
```

###  Exercice 4

This time same as previous exercise, but we pass an entity for favorite language. It could be a person, a city or a country. If a person can be defined directly as speak - language but if not we are looking if the person is born in a certain city. Then the city might speak a language. If the city language is not
defined then we look at the city's country language.

####  Hint
For this exercice you might need to access the factory of an existing entity. For example to join a factory
to the parent factory. For this you can just access the factory from an entity by doing

`$entity->factory->joinFactory($verb,$factoryToJoin)`

## Part III: Golang

Create an API service using `Go` programming language and `SQL` to serve the results from Exercice 3 and Exercice 4.

- For Exercice 3 build a simple `GET` endpoint to return all the result in `JSON` format
- Write an http test for Exercice 3 endpoint
- For Exercice 4 build a `GET` endpoint that accepts a language in the URL and returns the result in `JSON` format

The particient have full freedom to choose the method and the frameworks to provide the solution.
